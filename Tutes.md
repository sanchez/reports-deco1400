How did you group the tags

> Beginner and advanced are varying difficulties, idk if that is something i can choose. All levels is associated, can i filter by difficulty level on the side
>
> Grouped them because the concepts are the same, but on the site I wouldn't expect beginner and advance to be together

- Difficulty
  - When you play a video game you pick your difficulty level
- Learnability
  - Self learning, learnability makes sense
  - Interactive is key to learning
  - Reflection is key to learning, gauge how successful you were
- Fun Factor
  - Interactive website are fun, reading a static page can be quite passive and boring
  - It's interesting because i am curious and it feels more tactile
- How in Depth (*means not very in depth*)
  - I would go through the site really quickly
  - So the level of detail in the website is probably really shallow



# Person 2

How did you group the tags

> Beginnner and advanced are linked and interesting is cool
>
> All Levels and Quick are navigation type
>
> Reflection/SL/Interactive seem like quizzing

- Quiz/Review
  - Reflection/SL is like looking back at what you learnt
  - Looking back
- Info
  - Looking at Beginner and Advanced and interactive is like the middle of where you go
  - Middle man of the navigation
- Home
  - They seem like navigation and be able to go through the site
