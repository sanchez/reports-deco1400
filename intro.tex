\todo[inline]{Need to revisit this}

This design report is used to describe the process used to design and develop a website for teaching and instructing people of how version control systems work and the typical process flow of \gls{git}.

\subsection{Introduce Yourself}
% Briefly describe yourself
% What's your background?
% What's your skills, interests, degree, etc
% What's your learning strategy (as defined in the Week 1 practical) at the start of the course
I am currently studying in my fifth year of Engineering majoring in Software at the University of Queensland. My expertise is in low level computing as well as website application development, using modern frameworks such as \gls{react} and \gls{typescript}. I have completed my thesis under the supervision of Alex Pudmenzky where I designed and constructed a website and mobile application which interfaced with a series of different \gls{smarthome} applications. I am currently working as a developer at Aurecon where my knowledge of \gls{react} and \gls{javascript} are used to develop applications and work extensively with industry \gls{api}s.

\subsubsection{Learning Strategy}
Even though I have quite strong experience in JavaScript and website development, a lot of my experience has been through using frameworks and early release technologies. So my strategy is to create a well document which has good accessibility design and is supported incredibly well across all system. All features as well as most bonus features should be usable on all platforms.\\\\
Across my development I have not had much experience with the design phase of a project either, so it a goal of mine to embrace the design and learn as much as I can about the processing and thought procedures involved with designing and a website and not just jumping in immediately and developing.
